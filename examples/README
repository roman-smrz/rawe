Here are several examples of working with the library. They are all
included in the file Page.hs; in Main.hs is the server part and also
here can be chosen, which of the exaples is used.

The examples can be built end executed even without installing the
library itself by using provided Makefile. This needs GHC (tested with
6.12.3, but any sufficiently recent should work), all the dependencies
of the library (enumerated in the rawe.cabal file) and also
happstack-server, which is used to write simple server interacting with
the examples.
