rawe: ReActive Web Framework

Here is provided the source code of the library: in the directory src/
is the Haskell part, in js/ the JavaScript. For convenience, along the
library-specific JavaScript files is included the jQuery framework,
which is used for manipulating with DOM elements and to abstract from
some differences among the web browsers.

The library is structured as a cabal package, so the standard procedure
for building and installing applies, that is running:

> cabal install

should install the library along with all its dependencies downloaded
from Hackage.

To generate documentation from the Haskell source, run

> cabal haddock


In the directory example/ are some examples; they can be compiled and
run even without installing this library, but all the other dependencies
need to be met. For detail see README there.
